## 🟢 XOX Infinity Loop  
link [https://xox-loop.netlify.app/]

**XOX Infinity Loop** is a unique twist on the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. This version removes the possibility of a draw by introducing a dynamic gameplay mechanic where older moves are erased after the fourth turn, creating a continuous loop of strategy and excitement.
## 🎮 How It Works  
- The game board is the standard 3x3 grid.  
- Players take turns placing their markers (**X** or **O**) on the grid.  
- Once a player places their 4th marker, the 1st marker they placed is removed automatically, keeping the grid dynamic.  
- This looping mechanism ensures there's always an open tile, eliminating the possibility of a draw.  
- The objective remains the same: form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of your markers to win!  
## 🚀 Features  
- **Dynamic Gameplay:** The infinite loop mechanic adds an innovative twist to the classic game.  
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for desktop and mobile play.  
- **Minimalistic UI:** Clean and user-friendly design for an enjoyable experience.  
- **Interactive Feedback:** Highlights winning combinations and provides real-time feedback on the board.  
## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **HTML**: Structure of the game.  
- **CSS (Tailwind CSS)**: Styling and responsiveness.  
- **JavaScript & Reactjs**: Game logic and interactivity.
